# spacemacs-web-dark

A vim colortheme forked from [vimterial_dark](https://github.com/larsbs/vimterial-dark) with the [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) colors in mind. Vimterial has great syntax targeting and plugin support for web development, but I love working in the dark, mellow, purple-heavy environment of the Spacemacs default theme. I haven't run into any Spacemacs-inspired vim colorthemes with good support for web stacks yet, so maybe someday it can join the canon of well-beloved dark themes.

I haven't completely finished many details, namely some parts of the [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) theme and a few parts of the vim UI. The most glaring thing I've left unfinished is the naming of the global color definitions, which do not accurately reflect the color names at the moment. In a shamefully sloppy fashion, I'll address these issues as I encounter them while I carry on with my work.

## Installation
I'm currently using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug); this however should easily adapt to your preferred plugin manager.

Add the following to your vim-plug declarations:
```
Plug 'jcherven/spacemacs-web-vim'
```
