# Colorscheme: Spacemacs_Web

A vim colortheme forked from [vimterial_dark](https://github.com/larsbs/vimterial_dark) with the [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) colors in mind. Vimterial has great syntax targeting and plugin support for web development, but I love working in the dark, mellow, purple-heavy environment of the Spacemacs default theme. I haven't run into any Spacemacs-inspired vim colorthemes with good support for web stacks yet, so maybe someday it can join the canon of well-beloved dark themes.

## To-do:
- Rename globals for color names to match the updated Spacemacs colors
- Line number cursor color is a jarring gold/yellow
- Tweak syntax settings after spending some time with the new colors

## Installation
I'm currently using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug); this however should easily adapt to your preferred plugin manager.

Add the following to your vim-plug declarations:
```
Plug 'jcherven/spacemacs-web-vim'
```
